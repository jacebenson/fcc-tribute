# Tribute

This frontend project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Nodejs
- Git

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone the repo, `https://gitlab.com/jacebenson/fcc-tribute.git`
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/jacebenson/fcc-tribute.git
```

Install the required dependencies
```
cd fcc-tribute
npm install
```

To get this repo hosting I've included a npm script to spin up a server with this command;
```
npm start
```

## Development
//"start": "/node_modules/light-server/bin/light-server -s public/ -w 'public/**'"
## Deployment

This deploy's to gitlab today with gitlab pages.
So all that's needed is the content of the page needs to exist in `/public`.
